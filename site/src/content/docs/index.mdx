This site is generated from repo docs in `notes/`, `repros/`, and `backlog/docs/` and is meant to be read like “debuggable documentation”: every lane has prose + runnable evidence.

## How to read this repo

- **Lane hub**: the entry page with links + “10k-ft spine” (`occt/maps/hub-…/`)
- **Lane map**: where to look in OCCT source + dependency evidence (`occt/maps/lane-…/`)
- **Dossier**: human prose + invariants + key files (`occt/dossiers/lane-…/`)
- **Repro**: runnable “oracle” that makes the lane concrete (`occt/repros/lane-…/readme/`)
