## Body

### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Problem description

When I try to cross section a drawing I get a series of circles appear that I can't explain, can't remove and get no error massages for.

As far as I know there are no issues with the model. I insert the model into TechDraw, orientate it for a top view, then try to cross section this view to the left whish then fails. So far I have only had this happen to this model so I assume that there is something wrong with this model but can't find anything wrong. I can send a copy of the .FCStd file if required.
