## Body

### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Problem description

There are a few issues regarding the subtractive helix reported here but this one is about a polar pattern applied to it so might be a different cause. It's not a regression since it was initially discovered in 0.21.2 by a YouTuber.
