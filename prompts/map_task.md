# Map task prompt (OCCT)

Use this prompt when working on a **type:map** task.

Rules:
- Do not modify anything under `occt/`.
- Keep outputs in `notes/maps/` (and scripts, if needed, in `tools/`).
- When writing notes, cite file paths and class/function names used.
- Prefer using MCP tools:
  - Backlog MCP: create/update tasks, add plans, update acceptance criteria.
  - occt-lsp MCP: symbol lookup (definition/references/hover) to validate interpretations.

Workflow:
1) Read the task, then add an “Implementation plan” section to the task via Backlog MCP.
2) Identify which existing generators apply:
   - `just maps` (package scan + include graph + CMake graphviz)
   - existing filtered views in `notes/maps/` (core vs exchange/vis)
3) Produce the requested artifact(s) in `notes/maps/`:
   - If the task is “lane derivation”, write/update `notes/maps/lanes.md` with:
     - lane name + `lane:<slug>` label
     - 3-5 entry packages per lane
     - citations to `notes/maps/packages.md` and include graph markdown files
4) Summarize findings into the task notes (short, actionable bullets).

Acceptance criteria checklist (suggested):
- [ ] Map artifacts exist/updated under `notes/maps/`
- [ ] Each claim cites the map file used (and relevant symbols if applicable)
- [ ] Task plan added before changes
