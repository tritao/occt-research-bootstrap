## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Execute via prompts/backlog/map_task.md.

Primary artifact:
- notes/maps/lane-shape-healing-analysis.md (lane-specific map + findings)

Inputs:
- Lane definition and entry packages in notes/maps/lanes.md.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Map written to notes/maps/lane-shape-healing-analysis.md
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1) Confirm entry packages in notes/maps/lanes.md.
2) Extract include edges + package sizes for ShapeFix/ShapeAnalysis/ShapeUpgrade from notes/maps/include_graph.core.dot + notes/maps/packages.json.
3) Spot-check key entry points with occt-lsp hover (ShapeFix_Shape, ShapeAnalysis_*).
4) Write notes/maps/lane-shape-healing-analysis.md with evidence + suggested dossier entry points.
5) Summarize findings in task notes and mark Done.

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
- Wrote `notes/maps/lane-shape-healing-analysis.md` (sizes from `notes/maps/packages.json`; include edges from `notes/maps/include_graph.core.dot` / `notes/maps/include_graph.core.md`).
- Key entry points: `occt/src/ShapeFix/ShapeFix_Shape.hxx` (`ShapeFix_Shape`), `occt/src/ShapeAnalysis/ShapeAnalysis_ShapeTolerance.hxx` (`ShapeAnalysis_ShapeTolerance`), `occt/src/ShapeUpgrade/ShapeUpgrade_ShapeDivide.hxx` (`ShapeUpgrade_ShapeDivide`).
- Next: proceed to `task-7.2` dossier using the “Suggested dossier entry points” section.
