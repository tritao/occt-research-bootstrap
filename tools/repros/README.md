# Repros (runnable experiments + oracle outputs)

This directory is the home for minimal runnable experiments used to understand OCCT and to generate stable oracle outputs.

Structure:
- `tools/repros/<slug>/README.md`: how to run and what outputs mean
- `tools/repros/<slug>/golden/`: stable oracle outputs (prefer JSON)

Template:
